 - [One of the first hacking courses](https://youtu.be/fNzpcB7ODxQ) I reviewed on youtube: a 12-hour course on ethical hacking from TCM security. It's actually the first half of a larger [25-hour course](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course) that they sell access to on their website, but I'm currently watching the full version and haven't regretted buying it once.
- A great course to prepare for [eJPT certification](https://my.ine.com/CyberSecurity/learning-paths/61f88d91-79ff-4d8f-af68-873883dbbd8c/penetration-testing-student). Includes units on exploration, testing Windows and Linux infrastructure, and the basics of web application testing.
