- [Mimipenguin](https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin) is a tool for capturing passwords from the memory of processes running on a Linux system. It is usually used to retrieve passwords entered by the user in the terminal, such as system or application passwords.  Once started, Mimipenguin will start monitoring the processes on the system and try to retrieve passwords from process memory. If it finds passwords - it will display them in the terminal.
