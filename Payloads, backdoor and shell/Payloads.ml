In cybersecurity, a payload is a piece of malicious code that is designed to execute a specific action on a target system[6]. This code can take various forms, such as a virus, worm, or Trojan, and is typically delivered to the target system through a vulnerability or security flaw. Once the payload is executed, it can perform a wide range of actions, such as stealing sensitive information, disrupting system operations, or taking control of the target system[6].
